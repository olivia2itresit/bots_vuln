Prior to snapshot versions 4.0.6.3183  5.0.2.1610  and 6.0.0.609  Firebird is vulnerable if ExtConnPoolSize is not set equal to 0. If connections stored in ExtConnPool are not verified for presence and suitability of the CryptCallback interface is used when created versus what is available could result in a segfault in the server process. Encrypted databases  accessed by execute statement on external  may be accessed later by an attachment missing a key to that database. In a case when execute statement are chained  segfault may happen. Additionally  the segfault may affect unencrypted databases. This issue has been patched in snapshot versions 4.0.6.3183  5.0.2.1610  and 6.0.0.609 and point releases 4.0.6 and 5.0.2.

Following CVE-2025-54793 there's still an Open Redirect vulnerability in a subset of Astro deployment scenarios prior to version 9.4.1. Astro 5.12.8 addressed CVE-2025-54793 where https://example.com//astro.build/press would redirect to the external origin //astro.build/press.

"General","2025-08-16T01:15:27.567","CVE-2025-55286","z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. z2d v0.7.0 released with a new multi-sample anti-aliasing (MSAA) method  which uses a new buffering mechanism for storing coverage data. This differs from the standard alpha mask surface used for the previous super-sample anti-aliasing (SSAA) method. Under certain circumstances where the path being drawn existed in whole or partly outside of the rendering surface  incorrect bounding could cause out-of-bounds access within the coverage buffer. This affects the higher-level drawing operations  such as Context.fill  Context.stroke  painter.fill  and painter.stroke  when either the .default or .multisample_4x anti-aliasing modes were used. .supersample_4x was not affected  nor was drawing without anti-aliasing. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with ReleaseFast or ReleaseSmall)  this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. z2d v0.7.1 fixes this issue  and it's recommended to upgrade to v0.7.1  or  given the small period of time v0.7.0 has been released  use v0.7.1 immediately  skipping v0.7.0."
